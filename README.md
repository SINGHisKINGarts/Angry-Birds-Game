We tried to recreate angry birds and made three levels.
One can run it by downloading the file and opening it in any IDE (like-intelliJ)
Then open the IDE and go to Deadline-2 -> lwjgl3 -> src -> main -> java -> com.hitesh.angrybird.lwjgl3 
then open Lwjgl3Launcher.java and run it.
The game will be opened. 
Click on play, and the Level Screen will be opened. Choose any level you want to play.
