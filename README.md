We tried to recreate angry birds and made three levels.<br>
One can run it by downloading the file and opening it in any IDE (like-intelliJ)<br>
Then open the IDE and go to Deadline-2 -> lwjgl3 -> src -> main -> java -> com.hitesh.angrybird.lwjgl3 <br>
then open Lwjgl3Launcher.java and run it.<br>
The game will be opened. <br>
Click on play, and the Level Screen will be opened. Choose any level you want to play.<br>
